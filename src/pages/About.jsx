                    Hello! My name is Cameron Rawlins. I am a web developer working out of Northeast Ohio (although remote work 
                    is always an option).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can do both front end and back end development work using either a basic MVC structure
                    with handlebars, or a MERN structure with REACT (what this site is made with).
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interests lie mostly in a design capacity, but I can work with javascript in an 
                    application development capacity.
                </p>
